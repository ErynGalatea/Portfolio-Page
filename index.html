			<h2>Hi there! I'm Erin Tsai!</h2>
			<p>I'm a student software engineer taking part in the Thinkful course. I live in Gainesville, FL with my fiancee of two years.</p>
      <p>Growing up with videogames, I've become interested in:</p>
	  <ul class="text-centered">
		  <li>How to continue in my quest to create games.</li>
		  <li>Just how things work behind the screens.</li>
		  <li>How to create webpages dedicated to the things I enjoy.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>About Me!</h2>
	  <p>I've been drawn to software from a young age. I originally wanted to make my own videogames as a child, but as I grew and learned more about how things work behind the scenes, I've wanted to explore further and get involved with it myself! I went to college for a software engineering degree, but due to unfortunate circumstances I was unable to finish my term. With the help of Thinkful however, I can finally do something to set myself on that course once again!</p>
	  <p>If you need a new developer to help get things rolling, I'm your girl! Feel free to reach out to me at any time with the contacts listed below!</p>
